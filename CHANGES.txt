v3.4.0
    Key feature changes:
    * Formalize support for NDI SDK 4.5, enable encoding from NDI to IP.

    Developer changes:
    * Disabled by default, some debug code around x264 related to codec tuning.

v3.3.0
    Key feature changes:
    * A52 changes to allow bitstream selection from any SDI pair.
    * Support for UDP packets with less than 7 TS packets.
      This must be configured before issuing the encoder start command.
      Only tested with 1128 and 1316, the syntax is:
      set variable udp_output.transport_payload_size = 1128

    Developer changes:
    * GPU related changes for NVIDIA GPUs vs Intel GPUS. (No official GPU support)
    * 4K p25/p50/p59.94/p60 related improvements, better profiling in the video filter (in developer builds only).
    * When runtime thermal stats are enabled, check in multiple /sys/devices locations for thermal sensor metrics.
    * Changes for measuring BPS with higher levels precision for network output (debug logging)
    * Non-default debug messages add in developer builds.
    * Bit-rot Improvements when encoding from USB webcams (in developer builds only).

v3.2.8
    * VANC SCTE104 Disney BrandNet 52/01 messages being lost due to malformed CRCs

v3.2.7
    * SCTE35/104 detection/conversion not working for SD channels.

v3.2.6
    * Revert hevc: Enable SEI recovery points in nal output

v3.2.5
    * ac3/aac/mp2: sdi-audio-pair bug, resulting in the wrong SDI audio channel being encoded.
    * obe: when displaying codec stream configurations on startup, display the sdi audio pair being used.

v3.2.4
    * hevc: Enable AUD in output nals* hevc: Enable SEI recovery points in nal output

v3.2.3
    * hevc: set qpstep to 12 (from def 4) to allow the encoder to step by more than 4 qp units
            in the event of wild bitrate swings
    * hevc: interlaced. Reduce the CTU to improve the CPU encoding time. The alternative was
            allowing the video q get behind and force the QP to 40
    * hevc: interlaced, increase eminimum QP to give better performance CPU performance on still images

v3.2.2
    * hevc: Don't reduce the QP if the video queue gets behind

v3.2.1
    * hevc: two new options to consider in the future, added but commented out.
    * core: added skeleton funcs to eventually centralize a handful of process statistics
    * core: add a func to detect what kind of cpu the s/w is running on.
    * core: add a func to return the video encoder frame queue depth
    * muxer: don't warn more than once per second if the multiplex has no padding
    * video sei timestamping: various improves after hard including the source into ffmpeg for test purposes
    * video sei timestamping: rename core funcs across the entire project
